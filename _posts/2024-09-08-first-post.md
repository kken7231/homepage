I’ve finally launched this website to document my recent activities and achievements, creating a place where I can easily reflect on what I’ve accomplished over time.

My latest milestone is the submission of a paper to [CommNet 2024](https://commnet-conf.org/), titled **"MQTT-MTD: Integrating Moving Target Defense into the MQTT Protocol as an Alternative to TLS."** The acceptance notification is expected on November 13, 2024 – fingers crossed!
